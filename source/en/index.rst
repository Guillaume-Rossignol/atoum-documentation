What is atoum ?
===============

atoum is a unit test framework, like PHPUnit or SimpleTest. Though, we believe it has an edge on its counterparts thanks to :

* Its more modern approach and its use of PHP's latest features (>=5.3).
* Its simplicity and fast learning curve.
* Its fluent interface, making the tests as readable as the english natural langage
* Even though atoum continuously benefits from new features, backward compatibility is one of the main priority of the developers.
